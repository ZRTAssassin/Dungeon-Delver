# Dungeon Delver
A small, one level dungeon exploration project to learn the some more fundamentals of C# and gameplay programming.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Unity, C#, & [Dungeon Architect](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/dungeon-architect-53895)

My learning was focused on making a simple, 1 level game, that allows for multiple characters. The goal was to implement a controller as the primary form of control

## Lessons Learned:

Basics of navmesh for enemies, basics of light baking, basics of controller support, and the ability to choose between a variety of different characters. The jump from 2D to 3D was actually easier than I expected. Implementing Dungeon Architect as my level generation solution at a later stage gave me the chance to integrate third party libraries into an already existing project and the pain that can result from doing that.
